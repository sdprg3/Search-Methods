I used jupyter notebook to do this assignment (in python). However, I don't know how to import it as a homework so I am turning in my code in txt file so that you can copy and paste it. Do note that you need to also import the adjacencies and coordinates file to jupyter notebook



Also, i cant figure out how to do time in python so i may need a response on how to get the execution time of a function
